This lesson is adapted from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp

## Where are we?
This is Github - a free online version control website. This is a great spot to save and share code. 

## Why learn to code?

You interact with technology everyday. Using Instagram, checking your email, watching youtube videos: all of these things require computers to work, which use code to tell them how to work. This code is written by people just like you and me everyday. After today you might go on to program a website, make some digital art, process some data to understand your life better, or develop a game.

In particular, HTML lets you make webpages, edit a wordpress site (used by most major orgs for blogs), and make newsletters. 

## Getting started

 Bimonthly, I will update this page and we will work through a new section together virtually.
 
 We should consult about the directions we want this to go.


## Setting Up
 
1. Download VSCode, our text editor of choice here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

2. Make a folder for your HTML ventures
