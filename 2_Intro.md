```

### Web Browsers

A web browser will show you your webpage as you intend. 

Paste the above code into VScode and save as index.html. Notice the syntax highlighting. Right click it and open with your browser. 

### HML Documents

* All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: ```<!DOCTYPE html>```.

* The HTML document itself begins with ```<html>``` and ends with ```</html>```.

* The visible part of the HTML document is between ```<body>``` and ```</body>```.

### HTML Headings

Headings are ranked by importance, from 1 to 6. More important headings appear larger

```
<h1 Most important heading (1) </h1>
<h2> Kinda important (2) </h2>
<h3> Least important (3) </h3>
```
